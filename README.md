* Android code labs
* This repo will contain all the files and exercises for each chapter/lesson from this [link](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-kotlin-fundamentals/).
* **Note**. I have some experience with developing in android using kotlin but I want to try something new and maybe learn something new.
* **Note**. Some modules contain a *Coding challenge* and/or *Homework*. I've placed these in their respective .md file in the project.
