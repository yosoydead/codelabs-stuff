* **Challenge:** Add a second button to the app labeled "Count Up" that appears just below the **Roll** button.
When tapped, the **Count Up** button should get the current value of the result text view, add 1 to it, and update
the text view. Make sure you handle these edge cases:
    * If the result text view does not yet contain a number(that is, if the text view still has the default "Hello world")
    set the result text to 1
    * If the number is already 6, do nothing
    
**Done**
