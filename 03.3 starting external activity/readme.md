* This module uses the files from the android trivia app (module 03.1 and 03.2).
* My android trivia app combined both 03.1 and 03.2 modules because it wasn't working at first and I had to scrap it and re-do it.
	* **Note** that my version of the trivia app from 03.1 uses a newer version of the navigation and navigatioUI components so the code will differ a bit.
* For the purpose of this module, I downloaded the needed files from codelabs.
