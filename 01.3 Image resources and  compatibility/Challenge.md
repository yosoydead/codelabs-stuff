* Challenge: Modify the DiceRoller app to have two dice. When the user taps the Roll button, each die should have a value independent 
of the other.

* Tip: Create a new private function to get a random drawable image and return an integer for the drawable resource. 
Use that function for each of the die images.

* **Done**
