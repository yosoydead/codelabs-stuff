* Inside the ScrollView, add an ImageView above the TextView. 
When you run the app, this image, unlike the star, scrolls out of view as the text scrolls up.

* **Hint**: The scroll view can only have one child view. You have to wrap the two scrollable views, 
the ImageView and the TextView, into a LinearLayout.

**Done**
